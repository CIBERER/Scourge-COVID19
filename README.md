# SCOURGE COVID-19

# Spanish COalition to Unlock Research on host GEnetics on COVID-19
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), develops with wide clinical variability, ranging from asymptomatic infection to a life-threatening condition. Advanced age and the presence of comorbidities are well-known major risk factors of COVID-19 severity. In addition, male sex is another risk factor associated with COVID-19 severity, regardless of comorbidities.
 
International genetic studies based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and/or comparative genome sequencing analyses have been conducted to identify genetic variants associated with COVID-19 severity. Through diverse nested sub-studies, the Spanish COalition to Unlock Research on host GEnetics on COVID-19 (SCOURGE) consortium was launched in May 2020 aiming to find biomarkers of evolution and prognosis that can have an immediate impact on clinical management and therapeutic decisions in SARS-CoV-2 infections. This consortium has recruited patients from hospitals across Spain and Latin America in close collaboration with the STOP-Coronavirus initiative and leverages a centralized genotyping and analysis platform (https://www.scourge-covid.org).

<a name="study1"></a>

## A genome-wide association study of COVID-19 related hospitalization in Spain reveals genetic disparities among sexes (2022)
Here we describe the results of the first <a href="https://www.scourge-covid.org/" title="SCOURGE website">SCOURGE</a> genome-wide studies of COVID-19 building up on the patients recruited in Spain from 34 centres in 25 cities [<a href="#ref1">1</a>]. The discovery stage of the study comprised up to 9,371 COVID-19 positive cases and 5,943 population controls. Replication was pursued in an additional 1,598 COVID-19 cases and 1,068 population controls and in other studies from the Host Genetics Initiative (<a href="https://www.covid19hg.org" title="COVID-19 HGI website">COVID-19 HGI</a>).

### Access to the results of this study
To help advance COVID-19 research and allow the wider research community to access to the genome-wide scale results of the <a href="https://www.scourge-covid.org/" title="SCOURGE website">SCOURGE</a> study, the variant summary data resulting from the different SCOURGE analyses both for the overall and sex-disaggregated studies and with different outcomes (susceptibility to infection, hospitalization, severe illness, and critical illness) and control definitions (A1, A2 and C; following the COVID-19 HGI nomenclature) can be accessed after an internal assessment of formal requests received. Note that the individual file sizes are around 0.7 Gb each (approx. 7.5 Gb in total). 

### What type of results would be made available?
No individual level data will be made available. Granted requests will have access to a file with the GWAS meta-analysis variant summary data with information for the following descriptors:
 
   •	**CHR**
[chromosome]

   •	**POS**
[position, according to the GRCh38 reference]

   •	**Allele1**
[non effect allele]

   •	**Allele2**
[effect allele]

   •	**AF_Allele2**
[frequency of the effect allele in the study]

   •	**Rsq**
[imputation r2 on the study. An NA is indicated for the genotyped variants]

   •	**BETA**
[the beta (effect size) of Allele2 in the study]

   •	**SE**
[the standard error of BETA]

   •	**p.value**
[the p value from the study]

   •	**SNP**
[includes the Affymetrix probesetID that may be necessary for downstream analyses or a chr:pos:allele1:allele2 identifier for all others]

   •	**SNP2**
[a chr:pos:allele1:allele2 identifier for all the variants]

<a name="study2"></a>

## Novel risk loci for COVID-19 hospitalization among admixed American populations (2024)
Here we have conducted the largest GWAS meta-analysis for COVID-19 hospitalization in admixed Americans, comprising a total of 4,702 hospitalized cases recruited by <a href="https://www.scourge-covid.org/" title="SCOURGE website">SCOURGE</a> and other seven participating studies in the COVID-19 Host Genetic Initiative (<a href="https://www.covid19hg.org" title="COVID-19 HGI website">COVID-19 HGI</a>) [<a href="#ref2">2</a>].

### Access to the results of this study
To help advance COVID-19 research and allow the wider research community to access to the genome-wide scale results of the <a href="https://www.scourge-covid.org/" title="SCOURGE website">SCOURGE</a> study, the variant summary data resulting from the association study in <a href="https://www.scourge-covid.org/" title="SCOURGE website">SCOURGE</a> samples can be accessed after an internal assessment of formal requests received. 

### What type of results would be made available?
No individual level data will be made available. Granted requests will have access to a file with the GWAS data of <a href="https://www.scourge-covid.org/" title="SCOURGE website">SCOURGE</a> Latin-America (N=3,512) with information for the following descriptors:
 
   •	**CHR**
